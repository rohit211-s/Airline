## Description
This project aims to analyze how airline delays in the United States over a period of 19 years are influenced by factors such as COVID-19, weather, disasters, customer satisfaction, revenues, and income levels. The project will use public datasets from Kaggle and the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to extract meaningful trends and insights.

## Data Sources
- **Kaggle Public Datasets**: Includes airline information, airport departure details, delay types, customer satisfaction levels, compensation benefits, and scheduled flight counts.
- **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**: Provides data on airline operations and statistics.
- **COVID-19 Data**: Analyzes the impact of the pandemic on airline functioning.

## Scope
The dataset covers over 350,000 records from 2003 to 2022, encompassing information on weather, disasters, delays, customer satisfaction, airline statistics, and passenger statistics. This comprehensive dataset helps explore fluctuations in airline choices, identify common delay types and locations, and understand trends over time.

## Goals
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify key trends related to consumer complaints, travel history, airline operations, and revenues.
- **Interactive Interface**: Create a responsive web application for users to interact with the dataset and visualize trends.
- **Stakeholder Insights**: Provide valuable insights for passengers, airline authorities, travel agencies, government bodies, the tourism industry, competitors, and other stakeholders.

## Motivation
Due to redundancies and the high correlation between different attributes, managing this dataset within a database will facilitate complex queries and efficient analysis. This project aims to help various users understand airline delays and operational trends, enabling them to make informed decisions.

## User Interests
- **Passengers**: Find reliable airlines, plan trips, and understand fare trends.
- **Airline Employees**: Gain insights into job security, working conditions, and operational efficiency.
- **Airline Management**: Make strategic decisions based on historical and current data.
- **Airport Authorities**: Optimize operations and manage resources effectively.
- **Travel Agencies**: Enhance travel planning and customer satisfaction.
- **Tourism Industry**: Understand travel patterns and improve service offerings.
- **Competitors**: Analyze market dynamics and adjust strategies accordingly.

# User Interface Design

## Main Page
The main page features five distinct buttons, each leading to a different type of trend analysis. A central graph displays airline trips in the USA with delays shown over time.

## Trend Analyses
1. **Weather Affect Trend**: Analyzes how weather changes impact airline delays.
2. **Price Analysis**: Examines price trends based on route popularity, delays, and passenger numbers.
3. **COVID-19 Influence**: Shows the pandemic's impact on delays, passenger travel, and fares.
4. **Holiday Affect**: Projects how holidays affect airline delays.
5. **Airline Popularity Trend**: Displays airline popularity based on factors like cost, delays, and comfort.

## Mockups
Each trend analysis page includes filters for users to customize their queries and visualize data specific to their interests.

# Complex Trend Queries

1. **COVID-19 Influence**: Compare airline operations before, during, and after the pandemic to understand recovery trends.
2. **Airline Popularity Over Time**: Analyze how passenger preferences and delay trends influence airline popularity.
3. **Price Trends**: Investigate airline fare trends in relation to passenger income levels and travel frequency.
4. **Busiest Airports During Holidays**: Identify peak delays and no-delay periods at major airports during holidays.
5. **Weather and Disasters Impact**: Assess how weather conditions and natural disasters affect airline operations in specific cities.
